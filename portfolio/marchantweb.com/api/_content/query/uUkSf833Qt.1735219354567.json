It was designed to connect the dots on all service offerings available, even if they weren't immediately related to the customer's current needs. This was intended to solve a problem of lack of awareness when it came to the client’s expanded offerings, opening the door to extended conversations that focused on more than just what they needed “right now”. It used spatial organization to reveal connections based on customer profile, challenges, industry, market, interests and promotional initiatives. Finally, it easily surfaced applicable case studies and product demos when getting down to the solution level."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"xerox-3.jpg","src":"/project-media/xerox/xerox-3.jpg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"My role on the project was lead creative developer, handling the architecture and visual representation of the “graph” system.
